<h1 class="blue" >Hi,I'm Brayhan Daniel NieblaðŸ‘‹</h1>

I'm working on my readme in this moment, but for the moment I can tell you this:

I'm a software engineer jr. I like to do a frontend develops but if I need I can do some backend.
I like to do things what looks easy, fluid, natural and maybe the people see and think is less than the reality is because of the easy to understand, also I like to do things what the people like to use because is not only do something to function, I think everything Is already done in this life but I can do it more comfortable to the final task.
